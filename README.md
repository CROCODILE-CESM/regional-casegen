# regional-casegen
Short term goal is to have a one-stop-shop notebook that can set up an ocean only MOM6 in CESM run. Eventually, add other components (BGC, Ice, waves), and complement jupyter notebook with a GUI. 

This repository uses [regional-mom6](https://github.com/COSIMA/regional-mom6) to generate a regional ocean configuration, then CESM specific wrapper functions to set this configuration up within CESM.
